## 🌟 Core Business Capabilities

### 1. Super Admin Platform Control Panel & Lead CRM (`admin.opticalmanager.in`)
- **Restricted Admin Authentication**: Dedicated dark glassmorphic login (`/admin/login`) with zero public signup option and standalone full-screen layout.
- **CLI Account Seeding (Method 1)**: Super Admin accounts are seeded securely via command line (`scripts/seed-super-admin.ts`) using Supabase Service Role APIs.
- **SaaS Platform Telemetry**: 4 core SaaS telemetry metrics (Platform B2B Revenue, Active Outlets, Subscription Health, Approved Lead Conversions). Patient clinical counts are strictly isolated from platform admins.
- **Tenant Store Detail View (`/admin/organizations/[id]`)**: Deep-dive administrative page showing tenant profile, subscription LTV, physical branch outlets directory, assigned managers, and subscription extension/suspension controls.
- **Verified Demo Requests CRM (`/admin/leads`)**: Captures landing page store access requests, featuring 1-click WhatsApp messaging (`wa.me/+91...`) and status tracking (`PENDING` ➔ `CONTACTED` ➔ `DEMO_SCHEDULED` ➔ `APPROVED`).
- **Subscription Extensions & Store Pause**: Super Admins can add +1, +3, +6, or +12 months to any tenant's subscription and toggle instant store access suspension (`SUSPENDED`).

### 2. Multi-Tenant & Multi-Branch Hierarchy
- **Organization Management**: System Owners can manage multi-branch optical retail networks under a single clinical organization profile (`organizationId`).
- **Strict Shop Isolation**: Store managers and optical technicians are scoped to specific physical store branches (`shopId`), ensuring complete tenant data isolation without cross-shop leakage.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforces role-based permissions (`SUPER_ADMIN`, `OWNER`, `SHOP_MANAGER`).

### 3. Specialized Optical Inventory Taxonomy
- **Category-Specific Taxonomies**: Built-in support for 5 distinct optical product categories: `FRAME`, `LENS`, `CONTACT_LENS`, `ACCESSORY`, `SOLUTION`.
- **Optical Metadata Tracking**: Supports frame dimensions (`52-18-140`), lens refractive indices (1.56, 1.61, 1.67, 1.74), HSN codes (`9004` frames, `9001` optical lenses), batch numbers, and expiry dates.

### 4. POS Billing, Eye Prescriptions & Dues Management
- **GST Billing Engine**: Automated CGST/SGST/IGST tax calculation (12% for spectacles/lenses, 18% for solutions) and HSN code mapping.
- **Patient Eye Prescriptions**: Integrated SPH, CYL, Axis, and ADD prescription entry for Right Eye (OD) and Left Eye (OS) along with Pupillary Distance (PD).
- **Public Shareable Invoices**: Generates secure public digital invoice view links (`/share/invoice/[id]`) with printable PDF support.
