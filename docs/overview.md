## 🌟 Core Business Capabilities

### 1. Super Admin Platform Control Panel & Lead CRM (`admin.opticalmanager.in`)
- **Restricted Admin Authentication**: Dedicated dark glassmorphic login (`/admin/login`) with zero public signup option and standalone full-screen layout.
- **CLI Account Seeding (Method 1)**: Super Admin accounts are seeded securely via command line (`scripts/seed-super-admin.ts`) using Supabase Service Role APIs.
- **SaaS Platform Telemetry**: 4 core SaaS telemetry metrics (Platform B2B Revenue, Active Outlets, Subscription Health, Approved Lead Conversions). Patient clinical counts are strictly isolated from platform admins.
- **Tenant Store Detail View (`/admin/organizations/[id]`)**: Deep-dive administrative page showing tenant profile, subscription LTV, physical branch outlets directory, assigned managers, and subscription extension/suspension controls.
- **Verified Demo Requests CRM (`/admin/leads`)**: Captures landing page store access requests, featuring 1-click WhatsApp messaging (`wa.me/+91...`) and status tracking (`PENDING` ➔ `CONTACTED` ➔ `DEMO_SCHEDULED` ➔ `APPROVED`).
- **Subscription Extensions & Store Pause**: Super Admins can add +1, +3, +6, or +12 months to any tenant's subscription and toggle instant store access suspension (`SUSPENDED`).

### 2. Multi-Tenant & Multi-Branch Hierarchy
- **Organization Management**: System Owners can manage multi-branch optical retail networks under a single clinical organization profile (`organizationId`).
- **Strict Shop Isolation**: Store managers and optical technicians are scoped to specific physical store branches (`shopId`), ensuring complete tenant data isolation without cross-shop leakage.

- **Interactive Lens Power SPH/CYL Stock Matrix**: High-density optical power chart with `(-) Minus Power Sphere Chart` and `(+) Plus Power Sphere Chart` toggle modes, standard/extended power ranges (0.00 to ±6.00 SPH, 0.00 to -3.00 CYL in 0.25 steps), per-cell unit count inputs with active cell highlighting, and real-time total stock quantity aggregation.
